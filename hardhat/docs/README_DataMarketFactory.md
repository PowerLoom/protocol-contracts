## Overview
The [DataMarketFactory](../contracts/DataMarketFactory.sol) is a factory contract responsible for creating and initializing new instances of [PowerloomDataMarket](../contracts/DataMarket.sol). It serves as the primary entry point for deploying new data markets in the Powerloom Protocol. This contract follows the factory pattern to ensure standardized and secure creation of data markets.

## Key Features
- Factory pattern implementation for standardized market creation
- Event emission for market deployment tracking
- Built-in validation for market creation and initialization
- No upgradeable functionality (immutable contract)
- Minimal attack surface with simple, focused functionality

## Contract Details
- **License**: MIT
- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.24
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Imports [PowerloomDataMarket](../contracts/DataMarket.sol)
  - No OpenZeppelin dependencies
- **Pattern**: Factory Pattern

## Detailed Function Documentation

### Initialization and Setup

#### `constructor()`
- Purpose: Initializes the factory contract
- Behavior: Empty constructor as no initialization state is required
- Security: No initialization parameters means no initialization risks

#### `createDataMarket(...)`
- Purpose: Creates and initializes a new PowerloomDataMarket instance
- Access: External
- Returns: [PowerloomDataMarket](../contracts/DataMarket.sol) - The newly created market contract
- Parameters:
  - `ownerAddress` (address): The designated owner and controller of the new market
  - `epochSize` (uint8): Configures the size of each epoch in the market
  - `sourceChainId` (uint256): Identifies the source blockchain for data
  - `sourceChainBlockTime` (uint256): Defines the block time of the source chain
  - `useBlockNumberAsEpochId` (bool): Controls epoch ID generation method
  - `protocolStateAddress` (address): Links to the protocol's state contract
- Requirements:
  - All parameters must be valid (non-zero addresses where applicable)
  - Market creation must succeed
  - Market initialization must complete successfully
- Behavior:
  1. Creates new [PowerloomDataMarket](../contracts/DataMarket.sol) contract
  2. Validates creation success
  3. Initializes market with provided parameters
  4. Validates initialization success
  5. Emits creation event
  6. Returns new market instance

## Events in Detail

### DataMarketCreated
- Purpose: Tracks the creation and initialization of new data markets
- Parameters:
  - `ownerAddress` (indexed address): Market owner for easy filtering
  - `epochSize` (uint8): Configuration of epoch sizes
  - `sourceChainId` (uint256): Source chain identifier
  - `sourceChainBlockTime` (uint256): Block time configuration
  - `useBlockNumberAsEpochId` (bool): Epoch ID strategy
  - `protocolState` (address): Associated protocol state contract
  - `dataMarketAddress` (address): The newly created market's address


### Creation Protection
1. **Address Validation**
   - Zero address checks for critical parameters
   - Market creation success verification
   - Initialization success verification

2. **Immutability**
   - Factory contract is not upgradeable
   - Created markets follow their own upgrade patterns
   - No admin functions or privileged operations

### Error Cases
1. **Creation Failure**
   - Transaction reverts with "Failed to create DataMarket"
   - No partial state changes persist
   - Gas is refunded (minus used)

2. **Initialization Failure**
   - Transaction reverts with "Failed to initialize DataMarket"
   - Created contract may need cleanup (if possible)
   - No partially initialized markets

## Dependencies and Integration

- [PowerloomDataMarket](../contracts/DataMarket.sol): Main contract being created
- No external library dependencies
- No OpenZeppelin contracts used
